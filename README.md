[00:09.89] Looking out for a new horizon
[00:13.38] Reaching out, I can almost see the place
[00:17.33] Holding on with a heart that's frozen
[00:21.06] In the dark, but I am not afraid
[00:25.50] No, I am not afraid
[00:35.00] 
[00:30.87] We'll be free
[00:33.28] But I don't know where we're going
[00:38.32] You and me
[00:40.77] This is our life and we own it
[00:44.40] Like lions in the wild
[00:55.40] 
[00:51.85] Like lions in the wild
[00:59.44] Like lions in the wild
[01:10.44] 
[01:47.35] Looking out at the open skyline
[01:51.07] Reaching out, I can almost touch the place
[01:54.77] Where the lost ones find their freedom
[01:58.44] In the dark, but I am not afraid
[02:03.27] No, I am not afraid
[02:12.77] 
[02:08.27] We'll be free
[02:10.58] But I don't know where we're going
[02:15.84] You and me
[02:18.23] This is our life and we own it
[02:21.98] Like lions in the wild
[02:32.98] 
[02:29.56] Like lions in the wild
[02:36.82] Like lions in the wild
[02:47.82] 
[02:51.87] Like lions in the wild
[03:02.87] 
[03:21.82] Like lions in the wild
